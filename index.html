            <p><img alt="'... teachers should provide students with initial learning experiences... prior to an IVR lesson.'@wavebreakmedia/Shuttershock'" src="IVR-and-science-learning.jpg"/></p>
            <p>Research inolving almost 200 secondary school students has shown that while the use of Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) can increase student enjopyment in the learning task, when used on its own it may nto be the most effective tool for improving outcomes like declarative and preedural knowledge.</p>
            <p>The study's findings are shared in a paper published in the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/edu0000473">Journal of Educational Psychology</a>, authored by Guido Makransky, Niels K Andreasen and Sarune Baceviciute from the University of Copenhagen and Richard E Mayer, from the University of California, Santa Barbra.</p>
            <blockquote><p>'We conducted the study because there was existing evidence that IVR simulations lead to better learning outcomes specifically when students have the opportunity to reflect over the content,' lead author Guido Makransky, tells Teacher.</p></blockquote>

            <h3>Sphere CFO 'calmly' quit after MSG boss James Dolan's 'yelling and screaming':source</h3>
            <address class="author"><a rel="author" href="https://nypost.com/2023/11/07/media/sphere-cfo-quit-after-james-dolans-yelling-screaming-source/#">By Alexandra Steigrad</a></address>
            <time datetime="2023-11-7" title="November 7, 2023">Published Nov. 7, 2023, 5:07 p.m. ET</time>
            <p><img alt="James Dolan hit Ranji with an angry bout of 'yelling and screaming.' The Post has learned. WireImage" src="WHACKJAMESDOLAN.jpeg"/></p>
            <p>According to a source with knowledge, Dolan was “yelling and screaming” at Ranji, who in response “calmly” left the room and gave his notice to the company’s general counsel.

                “Gautam is very calm and usually can take it and roll with it,” said a source, who explained that the CFO had enough of Dolan’s hair-trigger temper.
                
                Dolan, meanwhile, “is the consummate hammer,” the source added. “He treats everyone like a nail.”</p>
            <p>Ranji — who had been the CFO of the Sphere, which also operates Madison Square Garden Networks, since last year — declined to comment on Tuesday.

                “They did a wonderful job burying the news,” said the source. “A CFO quitting less than a week before earnings is unheard of.”
                
                “The publicly filed 8K clearly outlines that his departure from the Company was not a result of any disagreement with the Company’s auditors or any member of management,” a Sphere Entertainment spokeswoman said.
                
                Dolan’s empire has seen its fair share of departures recently.
                
                Dolan has taken a hands-on role leading the Sphere since MSG Sphere president Lucas Watson left the company in February after he was hired the previous March.
                
                Christina Spade, CEO of Dolan’s cable TV broadcaster AMC Networks, left the company last November after a three-month stint in the top job.
                
                She had been at the company in various roles since 2021.
                
                <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/09/09/new-york-knicks-and-rangers-ceo-andy-lustgarten-resigns/">MSG Sports president and CEO Andrew Lustgarten stepped down</a> in September 2022 after eight years at the company.
                
                The Sphere is expected to post a quarterly loss of $1.27 a share, according to a survey of Wall Street analysts.</p>
